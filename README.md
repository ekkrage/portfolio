# Erin Krage Portfolio

Hi, my name is Erin, and this my portfolio!

I'm an aspiring technical writer based in Seattle, WA, and this page showcases a handful of projects I'm proud of. But first, a bit about me!

I grew up in Kansas then lived all over the Midwest before moving to Seattle in 2022. Prior to my time in the Pacific Northwest, I went to Iowa State University and earned a degree in Public Relations from their school of Journalism. I then pursued a career in copywriting before deciding to change my career path and attend the University of Washington for their [Certificate in Professional Technical Writing](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing).

Below you'll find a variety of my favorite writing projects, from both my time technical writing while at UW and my time copywriting at an advertising agency, and additional information on each project.

## Samples

### [API Documentation](https://starwipe.stoplight.io/docs/starwipe-api/jse08rmsinhvi-about-starwipe)
When researching technical writing and deciding if it was a good career fit for me, I continuously saw API documentation as an example of something technical writers may work on, of which I had no experience. So during my time during the UW Certificate in Professional Technical Writing, I decided to tackle API documentation head on and create my own using AI generated code.
### [Wiki](https://github.com/ekkrage/PTWGlossary/wiki/PTW-Acronym-Glossary)
While recieving my ceritication in professional technical writing, I learned dozens of new acronyms. For a portfolio project, I chose to create a wiki defining the acronyms included in our lesson plans to be used a resource for myself and fellow students looking to decipher the new terms we were encountering.     
### [Interactive Brochure](https://view.ceros.com/ck/adm-snacking-build-a-bar/p/1)
I'm currently employed by an advertising agency specializing in marketing for food ingredient companies. This interactive brochure was created for client promoting their ingredients that can be used formulate healthy snacks. The brochure outlines the consumer demand for "smart snacks" and how food manufacuring brands can achieve better-for-you snacks with the right ingredients.
### [Web Copy](https://www.admbuydirect.com/ordering/sweeteners)
Also developed during my time writing for ingredient companies, I crafted copy for 30+ web pages to create a cohesive website for purchasing and ordering a client's ingredients. The link above takes you to a page outlining a wide range of sweetening ingredients and benefits of working with the company.
